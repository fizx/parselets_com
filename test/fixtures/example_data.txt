            "comment": "At 16, Zucker started a business enticing people to pay $1 to take a swing at a golf ball. The prize for a hole in one from 150 yards: $1 million. He rented space from a driving range and persuaded an insurance company to allow him to pay a premium for a million-dollar policy. No one made it, but Zucker made some extra cash.This is one of the best ideas i've ever heard."

Seems like you'd need an 81 dollar premium per driver to profit.Further, there's a lot of asymmetrical information possibilities. What if a pro golfer (whose odds might be 1:500) decides to show up?"

However, you'd probably learn something after a couple thousand shots, so I'd give the 1 person a better chance."

            "comment": "The odds can vary a bit on where the hole is located and what kind of grass is next to the hole.  When you are looking at these averages they are hitting a golf ball on to a green, which typically is rather soft and allows the ball to stop relatively close to where it lands. A well hit shot that lands on the green with backspin, will slow the ball down quickly, and then it rolls at a speed which may be slow enough where it can fall into the hole.If you are trying to hit a ball into a hole at a driving range, the driving range could have either longer grass that slows the ball down quicker or alternatively, it could be on concrete with artificial turf, both of which would make it harder for someone like a PGA professional to find the optimum place to hit the ball.That being said, it would have been an interesting business prospect to try an arbitrage the contest by buying a large amount of tickets and hiring a PGA pro."

From Zucker's perspective a business (I would call it a scheme) for making money. Quite interesting.On a related note, Ansari X PRIZE (for the first private space flight) was partly funded through a similar deal with an insurance company."

That way, if the Red Sox win, we can be happy too.\"  And the Red Sox did win the pennant, and lots of people got free furniture.  http:\/\/abcnews.go.com\/Business\/PersonalFinance\/Story?id=3771...A bunch of crazy dot-coms were also funded with insurance policies, eg. treeloot.com (the infamous punch-the-monkey ads).

I would go to school in the city and I hated the taste of the water there.  Later we moved to the city and I remember how I then hated the taste of the water at my relatives' farm house.If given the choice between a bottle of \"spring\" water and filtered water, I always go with the filtered one, because I think it generally tastes better (and more like the water I drink at home).  I always find the \"bottled water is just tap water\" meme annoying, because it generally isn't \"just tap water\".  It's usually water that's been through reverse osmosis filtration and had added salts.  That's like saying that spring water is just rain water found in your local puddle."
