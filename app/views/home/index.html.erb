  <p>Parselets are little developer-generated APIs for a wide variety of websites (Try searching).  Parselets.com is a place to create and share them.  </p>

  <p>Parselets are written in Parsley, which is a superset of CSS selectors, regexen, and XPath, in a little JSON wrapper.  If you know any of the above technologies, you'll be fine.  You can run parselets from the command-line, Ruby, Python, C, or by connecting to parselets.com and using the web service.</p>
<p>  Parselets is brought to you by Kyle Maxwell and Andrew Cantino.</p>
