    <h1>Hi there!</h1>

    <p>We have a robot which we use to:</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>serve content previews of parselets on our website.</li>
      <li>serve api requests, which are intended as a way for people to try using parselets without installing compiled software packages.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Our robot should be low-traffic, and operates from the parselets.com domain (209.20.88.252).  It respects robots.txt. If you're having problems with our robot, or if any of our site users are causing trouble, please contact us at parselets+robot@gmail.com, or look in the contact info at the footer of our main website.</p>
    
    <p><i>Cheers!<br />Kyle Maxwell &amp; Andrew Cantino<br />Founders, parselets.com</i></p>
